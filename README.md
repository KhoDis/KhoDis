## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I'm an ITMO KT graduate and ex-Yandex software engineer working on real-world problems with full autonomy. [Purple Music](https://github.com/purple-music) has been a passion project. building it has taught me about systems architecture, cloud infra, design systems, and handling the messiness of real-world code.
